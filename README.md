# SUtopia - Sonic Utopia ReDecompiled

After 10 months...Sonic Utopia has been ReDecompiled with a newer version of AssetRipper!

# Differences between this Decomp and the Legacy Decomp

Working shaders. - Besides like UltimateBloom, like I fixed the shaders but it doesn't wanna work lol

NO additions at all. - I wanted to keep this as a pure vanilla decompilation so there's no DiscordRPC.

Different Unity version! - The legacy decomp uses 2019.4.17f1 (i think), while this one uses 2017.1.2p3. I originally had plans to do this in Unity 5 but meh.

# Ports
